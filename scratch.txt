Tu run karaf with the some excluded classes from a bat file we need to ,modify the actual java command lione to add 

-Dglowroot.weaving.excludeClasses="org/ops4j/pax/web/service/jetty/internal/.*" ^

We only need to exlcude the adapaters if the glowroot PR for jakarat+javax compatibility isn't accepted

We can't use setenv due to the number of times EXTRA_JAVA_OPTS is expannded and concatenated (or at least I got bored
of trying to figure out how to do it)
